# UCB CS61B (Spring 2018): Data Structures
Hi, I'm a math student trying to self-study cs61b. \
\
Homepage: https://sp18.datastructur.es/ \
Textbook: https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap1/chap11.html \
or https://cs61b-2.gitbook.io/cs61b-textbook (Fall 2024 Version has more details)  \
Autograder: https://www.gradescope.com (Entry code: MNXYKX)  \
Online Java Compiler: https://onecompiler.com/java   \
Online Java Visualizer: https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/java_visualize/#mode=edit    \
Discussions are Fall 2024 version: https://fa24.datastructur.es/  because I use Fall 2024 textbook.     \
Discussions are important to help understand the knowledge points better. It is not hard for me to finish the lab and projects but my discussion went wrong a lot :c
